# Student Records
## Origin of the project
  This project was constructed to discuss the purpose of Abstract Factory. Abstract factory is, “intent: Provide an interface for creating families of related or 
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes (Nahar and Sakib p1)”.

## Download and Startup
    At this moment in time there are two versions. The first version was contructed 
  in Eclipes as a maven project. This project can be found in a folder called JAVA 
  CODE. Be advice you must have Eclipse installed on your computer, java and maven 
  setup properly. If you need help please visit: https://www.guru99.com/install-eclipse-java.html .

## Java version
 For an example of Abstract factory we constructed  an interface called credit, where 
the methods, that are in place into the interface, are simple enough for any class 
to construct. For this assignment we constructed two different classes. The first 
class is High School class that will contain to list ArrayList A and ArrayList B and 
the seond class College will contain the similar ArrayList A and ArrayList B. For 
this porject when we want to call student A and then we cliecked the view buttion it 
will show all the creadits that were stored in both classes. Also with in each 
class, we constructed in inner class called Node. The inner class Node is, use to 
store in the name of the student, what class they took and the credit hour they 
received.    
Now for the most part High School credits and College credits values are different. 
However, in this javafx project, we allow any value that is greater than zero to be 
placed into credit. 

   ### Methods that were Constructed.
   - add() method that was inherited in both College and HighSchool class will allows     us to add a Node to an existing ArrayList. 
  - delete () method that removes a credit, that already exist on either student A or     student B and its possible to remove it by determining a student’s
    name, there are only two students A or B, and class name. This will delete a           specific course from either student A or student B. 
  
 ### UML Design and Discription

 ## HTML/CSS/PHP/JAVASCRIPT version
  Following with similar abstract classes we constructed the similar designs that will see in Javafx.
